## Foreword

> Please [create an issue ticket](https://github.com/uOttawaDrone/uodrone-site/issues) if you think there are links missing/any links that are broken.

| Link Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Repo` | GitHub repositories for resources under our organization |
| `Website` | GitHub pages for easy access to resources (i.e. procedures) under our organization |
| `Kanban` | GitHub project overview |
| `Current` | Resources currently being used/employed |

Anything labeled `(Website)` will be more accessible than `(Repo)`, but most actions will be taken only on `(Repo)` tagged URLs.

`Example:` Creating a wish list would can be done by navigating to our Wish List `(Repo)`. Finding out how to create a ticket & the convention for creating one would be done by navigating to our Wish List `(Website)`.
